If it's not necessarily obvious how an expense fits in with the project you're proposing, feel free to offer a brief explanation here. The <REDACTED> Foundation allows organizations to apply an administrative and overhead rate of 15% on grant requests over $100,000, and 20% for requests of $100,000 or less. The administrative and overhead rate for colleges and universities is capped at 10%. If, for some reason, you don't want to take any administrative/overhead, that's fine -- just be sure to make that explicit in this section so we know that's your plan and not an oversight. Even though this section seems focused on the dollars, some required resources might not come with a price tag.
